                        The Society of Musical Arts (SOMA) is a student organization whose main purpose is to support 
                        student musicians on campus. Their goal thus far has been to get involved with anything that involves 
                        music on campus. They are working towards building relationships with many of the student clubs on 
                        campus, and have already built working relationships with established groups like Gigabeats and Saavan.

                        <strong>Interview </strong>- Dr. Schachter is a professor and active researcher at the Martin Tuchman

                    <p class="left-aligned">
                        One of the easiest approaches to leading a life that directly benefits the environment involves 
                        taking action to minimize waste and reduce our contributions to land and water pollution. 
                        On campus, there are a few things we can do to be more sustainable. A good start is to know, 
                        understand and follow the hierarchy of sustainability: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle, commonly referred 
                        to as the 3Rs.

                    <p class="left-aligned">
                        <strong>Music Review</strong> — “Where Owls Know My Name” attempts to test the limits of progressive 
                        death metal music. Like many sounds from the genre, Rivers of Nihil have incorporated elements 
                        of jazz, electronica, and some ambience into many of the songs in the album. Although some of the ambient 
                        elements, along with an occasional lack of variation in melodies, at times make some of the songs seem 
                        boring to listen to, these qualities allow for a really good, relaxing experience.

                <p class="left-aligned">Taking photos has always been a part of people’s live. However, with 
                    smartphones and apps for people to share their photos, moments, locations, and “memories,” have things 
                    gone too far? Technology has improved immensely since the invention of the camera. Gone are the 
                    days when taking a simple photo was an arduous task. Today, taking a photograph is as easy as a 
                    click of a smart phone button.

                    keenness to uphold peace amongst his people. Aside from certain cases where he has chosen to grab all 
                    attention for himself, or to hit back against individuals who have “betrayed” him, time and time again, 
                    he has chosen to take party sides in important policy discussions regardless of the possible outcomes of the
